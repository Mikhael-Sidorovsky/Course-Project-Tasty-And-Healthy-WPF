Our program is designed for people who care about their healthy future. Based on your input indicators, such as: blood type and starting weight, we will help you achieve your desired weight in the optimal time for you. The program allows you to calculate an individual diet menu by blood group based on the parameters: permitted products, availability of products, cooking time. Each set of recipes consists of five meals per day. We offer you not just a set of menus, but also a detailed description of the preparation based on the complexity you set and the possible time. The program also keeps track of each menu within a day to count nutrients and calories consumed.
Attention! This program is not medical. In case of chronic diseases, please consult your doctor.
